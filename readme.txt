Instructions to Run this project
Kindly run this file in sequential order from top to bottom. Also to zoom into plots to extract more information from them I have used these two libraries -

I have commented on them for now but if for some reason they give errors in runtime(sometimes) It does not mean that my code is flawed it is a plain runtime error that goes away as soon as you start subsequent execution.

All the files of data and python must be in the same place, inside the same directory.
